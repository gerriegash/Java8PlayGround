00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,522
- I love this part!
- Me too!

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,889
I have strongly mixed feelings.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,209
So Howard's really in space?

7
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,842
The International Space Station,
250 miles that way. Heh.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,850
Right now Howard
is staring down at our planet...

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,480
...like a tiny Jewish Greek god.

Zeus-owitz.

11
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,048
I must admit,
I can't help but feel a twinge of envy.

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,043
He can look out the window...

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,966
...and see the majesty of the universe
unfolding before his eyes.

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,408
His dim, uncomprehending eyes.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,568
It's like a cat in an airport carrying case.

16
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,567
You know,
it's not exactly glamorous up there.

17
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,167
The water the astronauts drink
is made from each other's recycled urine.

18
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,407
Must be nice.

19
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,767
Nobody wants anything
that comes out of me.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,562
- I wonder what he's doing this very second.
- Conducting experiments in zero gravity.

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,366
Peering through his telescope
at the birth of the cosmos.

22
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,410

we know his life will never be the same.

<i>Don't be snippy.
I'm just excited to talk to my baby.</i>

26

How about calling her my wife? Heh.

00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,441
<i>Wives don't take boys from their mothers.</i>

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,206
They do, that's why we marry them.

AMY:
This is so exciting.

Soon my upper lip will be the same
fake-blond as my beautiful best friend.

Hey, this is my natural hair color.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,010
Now.

42
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,401
So does Sheldon have anything special
planned for you tomorrow night?

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,043
Yes. According to the relationship agreement,
on the anniversary of our first date...

44
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,044
...he must take me to a nice dinner,
ask about my day...

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,202
...and engage in casual physical contact...

46
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,489
...that a disinterested onlooker
might mistake for intimacy.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,247
That's hot.

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,047
You kids better use protection.

49
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,761
- How long does this stay on?
- Just a couple minutes.

50
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,646
- You've really never done this before?
- Once in high school. But I dozed off...

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,690
...and woke up with second degree
chemical burns on my face.

52
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,364
Oh, my gosh, that's awful.
Did the other kids make fun of you?

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,410
No, I had a cover story.
I told everyone it was herpes.

54
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,404
- So how's everything with you and Leonard?
- I don't know. It's still kind of weird.

55
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,042
We haven't really recovered
since he proposed to me in the middle of sex.

56
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,441
Oh. Boo-hoo.

57
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,883
If Sheldon proposed to me during sex...

58
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,771
...my ovaries would grab onto him
and never let go.

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,288
Leonard, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

60
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,765
- Interesting question. On the one hand...
- You don't even know what it is, do you?

61
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,888
The anthropic principle states...

62
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,965
...that if we wish to explain
why our universe exists the way it does...

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,885
...the answer is that
it must have qualities...

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,407
...that allow intelligent creatures
to arise...

65
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,562
...who are capable of asking the question.

66
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,088
As I am doing so eloquently right now.

67
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,042
I know what the anthropic principle is.

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,403
Of course.
I just explained it to you.

69
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,962
Now, where do you stand on it?

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,122
- Where do you stand on it?
- Strongly pro.

71
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,965
Then I believe that God
created the world in six days...

72
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,407
...and on the seventh
he made you to annoy me.

73
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,126
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

74
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,523
Raj, where do you stand
on the anthropic principle?

75
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,603
- I'm all for it.
- Thattaboy.

76
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,650
Why do you believe that he knows
what it is, and I don't?

77
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,290
Oh, Leonard...

78
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,967
...let's not take a saw to the branch
we're sitting on, shall we?

Hey, if you guys are free tonight
I heard about a spa...

80
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,320
...where you soak your feet
in a pool of fish...

81
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,209
...that eat the dead skin off them.

82
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,842
I don't need to tell you, in Los Angeles...

83
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,002
...sandal season is year round.

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,170
- Actually, I'm hanging out with Penny.
- Oh, okay.

85
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,970
Sounds like it's me and you.

on those puppies?

As I've stated before
on numerous occasions...

88
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,405
...the only sea creature
I would consider being eaten by...

89
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,650
...is the Kraken. Because the last words
I would hear are "release the Kraken."

90

Oh, okay. I'll just go home and be alone.

95

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,529

on your date night?

101
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,364
Oh, absolutely.

102
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,006
I have a contractual obligation...

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,767
...to provide Amy with conversation
and casual physical contact.

104
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:28,403

that I can't outsource that to an Indian.
